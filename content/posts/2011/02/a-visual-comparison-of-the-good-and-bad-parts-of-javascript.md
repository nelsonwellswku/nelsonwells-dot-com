Javascript can be very expressive and powerful in the right hands.  It isn't without it's faults, though.  For an actual dissection of both the good parts and the bad parts of the language, I recommend Douglas Crockford's book, [Javascript: The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596517742/wrrrldwideweb).  In the mean time, take a look at this picture.  The difference in page count between the Javascript reference and The Good Parts is pretty accurate :)
