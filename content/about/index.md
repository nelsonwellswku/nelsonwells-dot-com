I'm a full stack software developer with over 10 years of experience. My favorite stack is React, C#, and SQL Server, but I have experience with a much larger variety of stacks. My current work is writing web applications with React, Nodejs, and Mysql.

In my free time, I enjoy playing PC video games, biking, and playing violin (poorly).
